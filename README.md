# Linguists Without Borders

This is the codebase for the Linguists Without Borders app and accompanying website. LWB provides digital tools, training resources, and an online repository for the documentation of endangered languages.  The LWB app guides non-linguists through the process of documenting their own languages. The structured data collected by this app can be uploaded to a centralized repository for long-term storage and dissemination. Our enterprise aims to democratize the process of language documentation, catalyzing a paradigm shift in the field away from a limited cohort of professional linguists and towards scalable, public, crowd-sourced data collection.
